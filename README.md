# Matrix Encoder function

This repository contains my Computer Aided Design Course Projects at University of Tehran.

The purpose of this project is to design a function called encoder. 
The encoder function takes a 1600-bit input and returns an encoded output. 
The encoding operation in this function consists of several functions so that the output of each function will be the input of the next function.

The encoder function performs the encryption operation using five functions. 
This function receives a 1600-bit input and applies the 5 functions shown in the figure below to the input. 
This operation will be repeated 24 times and finally the output of the 24th repetition is considered as encrypted text.
